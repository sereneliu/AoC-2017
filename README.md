# Advent of Code 2017
These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017). 
## Why Python
Although I learned a little Python in [Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000), I have been mostly coding in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Therefore, I thought I would use this chance to practice! My friend Daniel has been showing me ways to improve my code (which you can see on the Daniel branch).

## Other Thoughts
I am learning so much from these puzzles each day! Highly recommend for anyone who is just starting out.

* Day 01: [-1] to get the last element of a list
* Day 02: how to compare two elements in a list
* Day 03: spent a long time on figuring out the formula for calculating the Manhattan Distance with little success before creating the spiral, which was easier and more useful for part 2...
* Day 04: set() for unique elements of a list
* Day 05: set j = i so that I can use the old value of i as j after modifying i
* Day 06: how to detect loops, useful for a future puzzle
* Day 07: set1.difference(set2) to find remaining elements
* Day 08: dictionaries (also eval/exec is awesome, but in most cases, I shouldn't use them)
* Day 09: how to break strings apart and put them back together
* Day 10: how to reverse elements in a list (also how to convert to ASCII & hexidecimal notations)
* Day 11: find max w/o storing all values
* Day 12: connected component (graph theory)
* Day 13: how to code without simulation
* Day 14: zfill, binary code
* Day 15: pypy is awesome
* Day 16: a more efficient way to detect loops
* Day 17: only assign as many variables as needed
* Day 18: think carefully about what happens with each if/elif/else statement
* Day 19: isalpha()
* Day 20: using sys.maxint for starting min
* Day 21: plane wifi is too slow
* Day 22: dict(zip())
* Day 23: how to reconstruct and optimize code
* Day 24: I hate recursion
* Day 25: how to use tuples to shorten code
