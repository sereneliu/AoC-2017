# Advent of Code 2017
These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017). 
## Why Python
Although I learned a little Python in [Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000), I have been mostly coding in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Therefore, I thought I would use this chance to practice! My friend Daniel has been showing me ways to improve my code (which you can see on the Daniel branch).

## Other Thoughts
I am learning so much from these puzzles each day! Highly recommend for anyone who is just starting out.
